            Hi there!
            <br></br>
            My name is Francis Carrasco and I{`'`}m a Full-Stack Developer Jr.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I like to use my creativity✨ along with my logical side to
            create code and web pages with focus on user experience and
            accessibility from different devices. I have developed projects with
            JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML, NodeJs, Firebase Auth, 
            Firestore Cloud, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, TailwindCSS, REST API. 
            Also, I have used Angular, Vue, Vuetify, Python and SQL.

            Little Fun-Facts: 🎇
            <br></br>* I{`'`}m a big fan of DC Comics, especially Batman 🦇 (In
            case you hadn{`'`}t noticed 😅).
            <br></br>* I{`'`}m also fan of JoJo{`'`}s Bizarre Adventure, especially
            the parts with Jotaro Kujo.
            <br></br>* I listen to a lot of different music🎵. My favorite band
            is Rammstein💥, but I also listen to Avril Lavigne and Queen.

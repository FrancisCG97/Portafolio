            Hi there!

            My name is Francis Carrasco and I{`'`}m a Front-end Developer Jr.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I like to use my creativityâœ¨ along with my logical side to
            create code and web pages with focus on user experience and
            accessibility from different devices. I have developed projects with
            JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, React, HTML, NodeJs, Firebase Auth, 
            Firestore Cloud, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, REST API. 
            Also, I have used Python and SQL.

            <br></br>* I listen to a lot of different musicðŸŽµ. My favorite band
